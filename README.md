# 🕵️ Crack Detection using OpenCV  

This project implements a **computer vision pipeline** to automatically detect surface cracks in images using **OpenCV and Python**.  
The pipeline applies **image preprocessing, Canny edge detection, and contour-based filtering** to highlight and classify cracks based on size and continuity.  

Currently, the project is being extended for **embedded deployment** (Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano) to enable **real-time, scalable structural inspection**.

## 📌 Overview  
- Loads a grayscale image.  
- Applies **Gaussian blur** to reduce noise.  
- Detects edges using **Canny edge detection**.  
- Extracts **contours** representing possible cracks.  
- Filters contours by **area threshold** (removes small noise).  
- Draws detected cracks on the original image.
